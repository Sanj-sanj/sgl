                Speeding is easily one of the highest source of poor fuel
                mileage and therefore unnecessary carbon emissions. This is
                something that is within the driver's control. We encourage our
                drivers to depart in a timely fashion and drive at the posted
                speed limits. Furthermore, our drivers are also understanding of
                their carbon footprint and are aware of the proper way to
                dispose of waste and recycle bottles and other recyclables
                wherever possible while out on a trip.
